Tha Deum of Paycmiam.

O in the niu, deserwd inne
ιὴο mourning prient is left nlone.
the mnymph hnunba no more the main,
1119 Dry-d from the grove is gone.
no bolt defends the Thundurer's brow,
vain, nin Apono‘„ windam now.
no spirit in the sutus dwolls:
the {iren die out that denthxess were:
und, wisc no moro, old oracles
summer and lie und eme.
untired, unrosting, everywhere
by soant und grove und sured well
the mighty Prophe& munds the kuell
of ull thy gods, Ο Graece.
