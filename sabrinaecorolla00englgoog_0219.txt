Β. How can I busk c bonnie honnie bride?

how can Ι busk a winsome marrow?
how lue him on the banks 0’ Tweed‚

thar slew my luve on hhe Brces of Yerrow?

, oYarrow fields, may never rain

nor dew thy tender blcseome cover3
forthere wes besely elain my lure,

my lure, cs he'd not been a luver.
the boy put cn his robes 0' green,

his purple vest, ’hwcs my aiu sewin'3
eh wretched me! Ι little kenned

he was in these tc meet his rnin.
much Ι rejoiccd that waeful day,

Ι sung, my voice the wocds returning;
but lang ere night the speer wne flown,

thar slew my luve end left me mourning.
yes‚ yes, prepare the bed ef lure,

with bridal sheehs my body cover,
unber, ye bridcl maids, thedom,

let in the expected husband luver.
hut who the expected husband ie?

his hunde, methinks, ure buthed in sleughter.
ch me! what ghoshly speetre’s yon,

comes in his pale shroud hleeding efter?
pale cs he ic, here lay him down,

ο lay his cold head cn my pillow3
take off, take off these bridal weeds‚

end crewu my cureful head wi’ willow.
