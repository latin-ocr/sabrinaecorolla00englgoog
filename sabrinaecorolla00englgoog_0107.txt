Where wore ys, Nympho f

χΑΨΗΕΗΕ] were ys, N ymphs, when the remorseless
deep
liolosed o’er the hesd of your loved Lycidas ?

ῥίον neither were ye pleying on the steep,
where your old bsrds, the famous Druids, lis,
nor on the shnggy top of Mons high,
nor yet where Deve spreuds her wizerd stream.
ay mel Ι fondly dream
hod ys boen there; for what could that have done?
whet could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,
the Muse herself, for her onehsnting son?
whom universal Nature did lement,
when by the rout thet made the hideous ronr
his gory visnge down. the stream was sent,
down the swiit Hebrus to tho hesbien shore.

ulus l what boots it with incessant esre
to attend the homely slighted shepherd’s trude,
end strictly meditate the thsnlrless Musei
were it not better done, ns others use,
to sport with Amaryllis in the shede
or with the tungles of N sueru's heir?
fame is the spur thet the clear spirit doth ruisr,
that lust infirmity of noble mind,
to soorn delights end live lnborions days.
but the fuir guerdon when we hope to find,
und think to burst out into sudden blane,
eomes the blind Fury with the abhorred shows,
end slits the thiu-spon life. ‘but not tho pruiso‚'
Phoebus roplied, snd touched my trembling eurs.
