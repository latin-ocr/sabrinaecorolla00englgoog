nrt thou oome and gone.
ae the wood when leaves ere ebed,
as the night when sleep ie eped,
ae the heart when joy is flod,
lem left lone, alone.
The ewallow summer eomes agaim
the owlet night resumes her reign ;
but the wild swan youth is fain
to lly with thee, false ns thou.
my heert each day desines the morrow,
sleep itself is turned to sorrow,
veinly would my winter borrow
sunny leaves from any bough.
Lilies for a bridal hed,
roses for a matron’s head,
violete lor a maiden dead,-
poneiee let my flowers be:
on the living grove I beer
matter them without a tenr3
let no friend, however door,
waste one hope, one sear for me.

Ideemed hie snying was not sooth,

but now experienoe proves ite truth3

for here is one whose stomooh‘s feets

procuro the food his stomnch ente.
