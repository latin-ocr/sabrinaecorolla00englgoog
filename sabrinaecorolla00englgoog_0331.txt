&fr among the hillo the eohoes ploy
(3532 a never, never-ending song,
to weloome in tho May.
tho Mogpie ohotters with delight;
the mountain Raven’s youngling brood
hove left the mother ond tho τιθεῖς
ond they go rombling east and west
in search of their own food 3
or through the glihoering vapours dart
in very wantonness of heare.
Beneeth arech, upon tho grass,
two Boys are sitting in ohe sun;
boys that hove hod no work to do,
or work that now is done.
on pipes of sycomoro they play
tho fragments of o Christmos hymn ;
or with that plant which in our dale
wo oall Stag-horn, or Fox's ΤαίΙ,
their rusty hats they trim:
ond ebho, os happy os the day,
those Shepherds wear the time away.
