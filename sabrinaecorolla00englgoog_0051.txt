SABRINAE GOROLLA.

H omlet s Soliloqcy.

[1¹¹¹th be, or not to be, t'hatis the question.
g‘ijj„ ' ᾗ. whether' tis nobler' ιιι the mind to suffer
{Q ‘¹' j] the slinge and arrows of ou rageous fortune
or to take arms against a see of troubles,
and by opposing eud them Ρ-ιο die, —to sleep,
no more ;-and‚ by asleep, to say we end
the heart-ache and the thousand natural shoeke
that ilesh is heir ιο 3—'tis e consummation
devoutly ιο be wished. ιο die ;-to sleep3-
to sleep l perchance ιο dream ;—ay, there's the ruh;
for in thet sleep of death what dreams may come,
when we have shuffied off this mortal coil,
must give us pause. there’s the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.
for who would bear the whips end scouns of time,
the oppressor’s wrong, the prend man’s contumely,
the pange of despised love, the law's delay‚
the insolence of office, and the sparus
that patient merit of the unworthy tekeS,
when he himself might his quietus make
witha bare bodkin? who would ferdels bean
ιο guent and sweat under aweary life3
but thet the dread of something after death,-
the undiscovered country, from whose bourn
no travellen returns‚-puzzles the will,
and makes us rather beer those ills we have,
thau fly to others that we know not of l
thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied o'er with the pale east of thought ;
aud enterprises ol great pith and moment,
with this regard, their currente turn awry,
and lose the name of action.
