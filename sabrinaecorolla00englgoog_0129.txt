Elemal Summer.

ᾖξ’) HALIi Ι compare thee to a summer's day?
' * ‘· thou nrt more lovely ond more temperate:
rongh winde do shake the derling bnds of Moy,
ond summer’s lease heth 111 too short a dote:
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines‚
ond ostonis his gold complexion dimmed;
ond every fair from fnir sometime declines,
by chance, or neture's changing course, nntrimmed.
bnt thy eternnl summer shall not fade,
nor lose possession of thet fair thou owest3
nor shall Death breg thou wanderest in his shode,
when in eternnl lines to time thou growest:
sodong as men cen breethe‚ or eye ean see,
so long lives this, ond this gives life to thee.

itis so gronnded inward in my henrt.
methinks no face so grooions is 11 mine,

no shspe so true, no trnth of such ecoount;
and sor myself mine own worth I define,

bnt when my glass shows me myself indeed,
beated ond chopped with tonnsd antiqnity,
mine own sels-love quite contrary Ι read:
eelf so sel flowing were iniqnity.

pointing my nge with beanty of thy days.
