{JJmfl BLITHE new-eomer, Ι have heard,

«εἷ’,

ἢ a. a Ι hear thee, and rajoice:
a *⁶5² 0 Cuckoo, shall I eall thee bird,
or but a wandering voice?
while I am lying on the grass,
thy two-feld shoul I hea1·;
from hill to hill it seems to pass,
ah onoe far off aad nean.
though babbling only to the vale
of sunshine and of flowers,
thou bringesh unte me a tale
of visionary hours.
thrice weloome‚ darling of the sp1·ing;
. e’en yet thou arh lo me
no bird, bul an invisible thing,
a voice, a mystery:
the same whom in my schoolboy days
I listened to3 that cry
which made me look a thousand wayS,
in bush and tres and sky.
to seek thee I did often rove
through woods aad on the green3
and thou werla slill a hope, a love,
still looked for, never seen.
and Ι ean lislen to thee yet,
ean lie upon the plain
aad lishon, till I do hegeh
that golden time again.
oblessed bird, the earth we paee
again appears to be
an unsubstanhial fairy place,
thal is fit home for thee.
