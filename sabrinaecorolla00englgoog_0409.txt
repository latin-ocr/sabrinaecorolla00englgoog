omm upon tha mighty ocean
deep we plough tho wswry main:
all its chimen of reseless motion

Now we we the snn’s vrum finger

now we see the pule moon linger,
orn she seek her morning bed.
Now we wmh the suamjng bino-v,

Ne'er nhnu thoy, who never wnuder

eope with ns, who dnuy ponder
nn thy tre-sures, mighey sen.
