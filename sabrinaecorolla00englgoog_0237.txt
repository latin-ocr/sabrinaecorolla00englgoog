Tho Ooonlry Olorolryard.

fill {roy the lowing herd winds slowly o'er the loo,
ζ lill lhe ploughman homeward plods his weary wey
ond leores tho world 10 darkness and to mo.

now fades lhe glimmering lendsoepe on the sight,
ond all the air o solemn stillnoss holds,

save where the beetle wheels his droning ssight,
or drowsy tinklings lnll tho distent folde3

save that from yonder ivy·mentled lower

11ιο moping owl does 10 the moon oomplnin

01 such as wendering near her secret bower

molest her ancient solitery reign.

beneelh those rugged elme, thot yewlree's shodo,
where heaves 11ιο tnrl' in many o mouldering hosp,
eooh in his narrow oell for over leid

the rude forefathers 01 the homlel sleep.

tho breezy coll 01 incense-brerthing morn,

the swollow twittering from the sorrow-built shed,
the oook's shrill olarion, end lhe eohoing horn,

no more shall ronse thern from their lowly bed.
sor them no more the blaning heerth shall burn,
or busy housewife ply her evening earo,

no children run to lisp their sire’s return,

nor olimb his knees tho onried kiss to share.

011 did the harvest to lheir sickle yield,

their furrow 011 lhe stubborn glebo hes broke:
how joonnd did they drive their leam ofield!

how bowed the woods beneeth their slnrdy stroke!
101 nol ombilion mook their useiul toil,

their hemely joys end destiny obscure,
