'gfff' than whom a better senator ne’er held
''²“ thehelm of Rome, when gowns, not arms, repelled
the fierce Epirot, end the African bold3
whether to sethle peace, or to unfold
the drift of hollow steten hard to be spelled3
then 1ο adrine how war may beet upheld
move by her two mein nerves, iron end gold,
in all her equipege: besides to know
both spiritual power and civil, what each means,
what severe eech‚thou hest learned, which few heve dono.
the bounde of either nword to thee we owe:
therefore on thy firm hand religion leons
in peace, ond rechons thee her oldest son,
monor.
