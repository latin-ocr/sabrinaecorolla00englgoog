200 SABBIXAB conotus.

the mggling punga of couscious truth ιο hide
to queuch the bluahes of ingenuous shsune,

or heap the shrine of luxury und pride

with incense kindlcd at the muse’s fleme.

fur from tho maddiug crowd’s iguoble strife,
their sober wishes never learned to easy:
along the cool sequestered vale of lise

they kept the noiseless teuour of their way.
yet even these boues from insult to protect
some smil memorial still erected nigh,

with uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deoked,
implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

their name, their years spelt by the unletterod muse
the place of fame aud elegy supply,

aud many a holy text urouud she strowe,

that tcach the rustic moralist ιο die.

for who ιο dumb lorgctfulncss a prey

this pleasing anxious being e'er resigned,

left the warm precinctu of the cheerfnl day,
nor cast oue longiug lingering look behind?
on some fond breast the parting soul telios
some pious drops the closing eye requires3
even from the tomb the voice of nature ories,
even in our ashes live their wouted lires.
forthae, who mindful ottho unhonoured dead
dost iu these lines their artless tale relate,

if chance, hy lonely contemplation led,

nome kiudred spiiit shall euquirc thy fate,
haply some hoary-headcd swain may say

‘oft have we seen him at the pecp of dawn
brushing with hasty steps the dcws away

ιο meet the sun upon the upland lawu.

there ou the foul of yonder nodding beech,
that· wreaths its old lantastic roots on high,
his listless length at noontide would he strctch
and pore upon the brock that babbles by.

hard by yon wood‚ now smiling as in scorn‚·
muttoning his wnyward fancies would hc rove;
