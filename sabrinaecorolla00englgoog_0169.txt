AREWELL, too little und wo lately known,
whom 1 begu to think ‚na ειη my omn

for sure om· touls were nen· tllied, md thina

one common nota on either lyra did atrike,

und kmves md foul· we both abban-ed nlike,

to tho nme goul did both our studim drive:

the last set out the monent did nrt-ive-

thus Ninus full upon the alippery plue,

whflst hin young friend performed mel που the mn.
ο only ripe, to thy abundant storo

what could ulmeing nge have added more ?

it might (what nature never given the young)

have taught the numbers of thy tantive tangue.

but antire mods not those, and wit will ahino
through the hux-hh cadunoe os ι ruggeri line.

n noble orror and bnt aeidum made,

when poeta ue by too much soree betrayed.

thy generem fruita, though guthsred ere their prime,
stin showed ι quiekuess ς aad mun-ing time

but mellnws what we write to thu dull sweets uf rhyme.
onus moro hail nna πωπω summu, thou young,
but th ! too short Marcellus os our tongum,

thy brawa with ivy md with lum-⁸1⁸ bound3

but tm md gloomy night mumma the„ mund.
