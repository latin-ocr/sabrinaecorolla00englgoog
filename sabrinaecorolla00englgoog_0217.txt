’ Q end level ruys oleove wide the thirety pleine 3
when heifers eeek the ehade eud oooliug lake,
end in the middle pethwey beeks the snake:
o lead me, guard me from the sultry heure,
hide me, ye foreste, in your oloeest bowere,
where the tull oek hie epreediug arms entwinee,
end with the beeoh e mutual ehede combines3
where flows the murmuring brook inviting dreeme,
where bordering hanel overhenge the streame,
whose rolliug current, winding round end round,
with frequent fell makes ull the wood resouud.
upon the mosey oouoh my limbs 1 uest,
oud e'en et noou the eweete of eveuing toste.
