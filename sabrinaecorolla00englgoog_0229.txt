¹¹. γ’, now give eloose to theeleen genereus steed,
Ῐ ‹32ss flourish the whip‚ nor spere the gelling spur,
but in the mednese of delight forget
yonn feere. sar o'er the rooky hills we range,
ond dangerous our oonnse; but in the breve
true oournge never fails. in vain the stream
in foeming eddiee whirls: in vain the ditch,
wide Καρίης, threatens death. the oreggy sheep,
where the poor dizzy shepherd crewle with core,
end olings to every twig, gives us no pein3
but down we sweep, as stoops the seleon bold
to ponnoo his prey. then np the opponent· hill,
hy tho ewifh motion slung, we mount alost:
eo ships in winter sees now sliding sink
odown the sheepy wove, then, tossed on high,
ride on the hillows, ond defy the etorm.
what lengths wo poss ! where will the wandering ohnse
lead ue bewildered? smooth ae swnllowe skim
tho new-shore mend, ond fon more swist, we fly.
neo my breve pack: now to the hend they prese
joetling in close noroy, then moro diffuse
obliquely wheel‚ while from their opening mouths
the vollied thnnder breaks. so when the ornnes
their annual voyage steen, with wauton wing
their figure ofh they change, ond their lond clang

from cloud to cloud rebounds.

fflfl the Hexameter riees the sennhein’s undulous
column,
in the Pentameter then falling melodious down.
