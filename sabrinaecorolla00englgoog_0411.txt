ΟΠ that hm lover] ιιο long and wall
the νιΙθέ deep quiet struma,
λ where the pure vater-lilios dwell
shedding forth tenden- glomus ;
md o'er the pool the Mny-fly‘u πίῃς
glum in gumen mu of spring.
Oh! lone und lovely hnuto are filine,
aare, nott the river ssows.
wearing the shmiow uf thy line,
the gloom ot alden· boughs;
-ud in the midst, a richer hus,
one gliding vein os heaven's own blus<
And there hut low sweet munds are hend—
ιίιε whissper of the read,
the plmhing trout, the rustling bird,
the scytha upon the mend ;
yet, hhrough the mun-nuring osium near
there secale a step which mortale seur.
'Tin not the sug that comes to lave,
‚t ηοω, his pmfing bmst ;
'tis not the bittom hy the wnve
making her sedgy uest.
the nir is fill'd with summm-'s bruach ;
the young flowers laugh, yet look! ’tis death.
But if, where silvax-y currente vove,

hassa leat-ned to rond the words of love
that ubine o'ex· nature's page ς
if hely thougnts thy guenta have been
under the shade uf willuw green,
Thau, lover os the silent hom·

theme hunt thou drawn ι fuich, a power
ιο oheer thee through the laun
and, went ou brighwr ποι-ΜΕ ω dwelh
