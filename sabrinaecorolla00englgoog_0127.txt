86 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Sonq os Comus.

’ ’ζῖῗὲ ΗΕ star that bida the shepherd sold
η”ἶ ’ξ now the top of heaven doth hold;
ἐῗς j· and the gilded aar of day
hia glowing axla doth ailay
in the steep Atlantia stream3
and tha slope sun his upward beam
shoots against the duaky pole,
pacing toward the other goal
’ of hia ahamber in the east.
meanwhile, welcome joy and feast,
midnight shout aad revelry,
tipsy danae and jollity:
braid your looks with rosy taine,
dropping odonia, dropping wine.
rigour now is gone to bed,
and advice with scrupulous head,
strict age aad soar severity,
with their grave saws, in slumbar lie.
wa, that are of parer fiae,
imitate the starry quire,
who in their nightly watchful spheres
lead in swift round the months and years.
· ausos.

Traoaoa.

ἶ ’ζῗῑῖῇ ΗΑΤ treason never prospers, what's the reason?

A, ἰᾷ why, when it prospers, none dare call it treasoa.
