76 SABRINAE OOROLLA.

The Hert os Satan.

‘ssffND now

:iis-1 hl advaneed rn view they stand, aherrid frent
listi of dreadful lengt th and dazzling arms, in guiso

ol warriors old with ordered spear and shield,
awaiting what command their mighty ahiel
had to impose. he through the armed files
darts his experieneed eye and soon traversa
the whole battalion views, their order due,
their visages and stature as of gods:
their number last he sums. and now his heart
distende with pride and hardening in his strength
glories3 ior never since created man
met such embodied soree, as named with these
could merit more than that small infantry
warred on by cranes; tho’ all the giant brood
of Phlegra with the heroic rare were joined
that fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side
mixed with auxiliar gods 3 and what resounds
in fable or romanoe of Uther's son
begirt with British and Armorie knights.
miror.
