1ο deek ils poel's sylvan grave.
in yon deep bed of whispering reads
his airy harp shall now be laid,
that ha, whose hearl in sorrow bleeds,
may love through life the soothing shade.
remembranoe oft shall haunt the shore
when Thames in summer wrealhs is drest,
and oft suspend the deshing oar
1ο bid his gentle spirit resl3
and oft, as Elusa and Heallh retiro
1ο breezy lawn or forest deep,
the friend shall view yon whitening spire,
and mid the varied landsoape weep.
bulthen, loru stream, whose sullan tide
no sedge-orowned sistere now attend,
now waft me from the green hill's side,
whose cold turf hides the buried friend.
and see, the fairy valleys fade,
dun night has veiled the solemn view ;
yet once again, dear parled shade,
meek Nature’s child, again adieu!
long, long shy stone and pointed clay
shall melt the musing Briton’s eyes;
‘0 vales and wild woods,' shall he say,
‘in yonder grave your Druid lies.'
