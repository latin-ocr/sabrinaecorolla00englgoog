16 SABRINAE OOROLLA.

Martinam.

{zm Τ ie the day of Martelmas3

a, ee cupa of ale should freely pass. le
h 3¹¹5} what though winter hae begnn

to pueh down the summer ann?
to our fire we ean betake,

and enjoy the erackling brake,
never heeding winher'a face

on the day of Martelmaa.

Some do the city now frequent,
where eoshly shows and merrimenh

do wear the vapourish evening out
with interludo and revelling reue,
anah aa did pleaeure England'a queen,
when here her royal grace was seen3
yet will they not this day let pase,
the merny day of Marhelmas.

When the daily sporta hedone,
round the marka-eroes they run,
prentice lade and gallant blades
dancing with their gamesome maida ;
till the beadle‚ stout audeone,
ahakes his bell, and calls the hour;
then farewell lad and farewell lass
to the merny night of Martelmas.

Mantelmas shall come again,
spite of wind and snow and rain;
but many a strange thing must be done,
many a cause be lost and wan,
many a tool must leave his pals,
many a werldling cheat himself,
and many a marvel come to pase,
before return of Martelmaa.
