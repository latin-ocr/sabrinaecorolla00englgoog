'with au ns barke of fleo career,
and flego end breones free?
I miss the voice of wareo, the first
that woke my ohildieh glee,
the measured chime, the thundering burst:
where is my own blue eea?
sweet breath may with your myrtles riso,
end sofh your winds may be:
yet my eiok heort within me dies :—
where ie my own blue seo?
Ι hear the shepherd’e mountain flute,
I henr the whiepering hree':
the eohoee of my eorl ore mute :-
where is my own blue see?
remen uerrere.
