SABRINAE OOROLLA.

'l'he Ohssd'e Wee m Jeme.

ff] ww *¹,0THER mother, the winde ere ot play,
ι ,1, 1 *1141 prithce‚ let me be idle todey.

Μωῑέ look, deor mother, the flowero all lie
languidly under the brigbt blue sky.
eee bow olowly the etreemlet glides;
look how the violet roguiohly hidee;
eren the butterfly rests on the rose,
end scarcely eips the eweete ee he goes.
poor 'I'rey ie celeep in the noondoy eun,
end the fliee go about him one by one;
end Poesy site neer with e eleepy grece,
without ever thinking of weshing her fece.
there flios e bird to e neighbouring tree,
but very lezily flieth he;
and he sits end twitters e gentle note,
thet scarcely ruffles his little throot.
you bid me be buey; bnt, mother, heer
how the humdrum gresshopper soundeth noar ;
end the eost west-wind ie so light in its play,
it scarcely moves e leaf on the sprey.
Ι wieh, oh Ι wish, Ι were yonder cloud,
that soils about with ite misty shroud:
books end work I no more should sec,
but I’d come end floet, deor mother, o’er theo.
remon neuere.
