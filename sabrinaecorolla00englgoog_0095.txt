nto Primrose.

Νρῗδῇ me why I send yon here

ι , 1s firstling of the infant year:

{set-:1⁴ ask me why I send to yon

this primross all bepearled with dew;

1 straight will whisper³ 1n your ears,

the sweets of love are weshed with teors.

Ask me why this flower doth show

so yellow, green, ond sickly too;

osk me why the stolk is wesk,

ond, bending, yet it doth not brenk3

I must tell you, these discover

what doubts end sesrs sre in olover.
