in love of those that lie asleep!
for cupid is n merny god,
end foroeth none to kiss the rod.
My songs they bo of Cynthia's preiso,
I wear her ringo on holideys,
in every tree 1 write her nome,
ond every day I read tho some.
where honour Cupid's rival ie,
there mirocles ore seen of hie.
If Cynthio orave her ring of me,
I blot hor name out of the tree3
if doubt do darken things held deor,
then well-fore nothing once o year.
for many run, but one must win:
foole only hedge the onokoo in.

LORD nssooxn.

Phyllis aske your ‘name and college.’
nh, my friend, to beart you're lnying

‘swellows come end go with wenth0r3
sriende ond Fortune fly together)
