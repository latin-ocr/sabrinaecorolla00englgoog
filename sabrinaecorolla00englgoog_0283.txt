’LL sing yon a good old song
clm was made by a good old pute,
of a Ιὶιιο old English gentlemnu
who had an old eamne,
und who kept up his old mansion
ιιι ιι bouum-121 old mm, ,
with a good old portm- to relieve
tha old μοι· at his gnte,
like Α flue old English gaussenum, all of the alden time*
His hun so old wne hung arnaud
with pikee und guns und bows,
and swords and good old buoklers
§hut had swod some stough old blows.
'uvas there his worship sal iu state
in doublet und truuk hose,
und qumod his cup of good old sack
to wax-m his good old none,
like ι fine old English gmtlemnn, all of the oldeu time,
When winber cold brought frast nnd snow',
ho opened house w all:
und though three acore und teu his 51³an,
he fently lead the bnss.
xmr was the houseless wunderer
e‘er driven from his hall :
for while he feuwd ι11 the grem.
he ne'er for-got the small,
like n fine old English gentleman, nll of the oldam time.
But ιιι ,ι lm must yiald ιο sam
so, like the ebbing fide,
deolining gently w the oomb,
thia good old mnu 11⁴³ died.
the widow’s and the orphan¹s tem·
