The Luat Man.

nn worldly nup„ mu mon in gloom,
the nun himself munt die,

  

¹ foro thi· mon-al shall ”sume
im immomlity.
1 saw a rinion in my nlnp,
that gave my spirit strength ω swwp
ndown tha galf of Time:
I saw the lut os human mould
unt ulull mtion's daath behold,
u Adam now har primo.
The uuu's eye lud a sickly glue,
the eurth with ogo ww wan,
the skslewns of natium were
:round tlut louely man.
sume lud expired in fight, the brands
stin rum-i in their bony handu
in plagae nne] famine some:
etsth’s citios lud no nonna nor tread ς
und ships were dristiug with the dead
ω shores when-s all wu dumb.
Yet, prophet-like, that lone oue stood
with annullans words and high,
clm nhook the εει-ο lewes frum the ποσὰ,
aa if n ιιιοηιι passed by:
ming: *wa are min„ iu anuh, prend nun,
thy sace in oold. thy noe is run,
'eia morey bida thee go:
fin thou wn thousand thousand γῦπε
luat seon the fide of human teau,
which shall no longer flam.¹
