EEP nemore nor sigh nor moun ;
ahl eissille seruisse
makes not fresh nor grow again.
trim thy looks, look oheurfully;
fate's hid ends eyes cannot see:
- joys as wingdd dreams fly fast3
why should sudness longer last?
grief is but u wound to woe;
gentlest fair, mourn, mourn no mo.

I meant euch softest virtue there should meet,
,fit in that soster bosom to reside. Α
only a learned and o munly sonl
Ι purposed her, that should with even powers
the rock, the spindle‚ und the sheors control
of Destiny, und spin her own free hours ;
such when I meent to feign, ond wished to see,
my muso bade Bedford write, und thet was she.
