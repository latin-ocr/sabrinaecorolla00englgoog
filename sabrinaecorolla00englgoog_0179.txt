The End.

 
    

UR rnvels now ure ended. theso our amors,
ns Ι fontold you, were ull spirits, and

are malbod into air, into chin nin

nn , like the huelem subu-ic of this vision,

the cloud-cupped mowers, the gorgeons paneas,
the solemn templa, the gron globo itaelt,

γει au which it inherit, shall dissolve.

and, like thia innubat-:mim page-nt ended,

leave not n rank behind. we ure such stufl‘

ns lix-sama are made on. and our little life

in rounded with a uleep.

sannarum.
