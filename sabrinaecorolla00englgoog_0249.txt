How swaetly bloomad tha gay green birk,

for dear to ma aa light and life
was my aweet Highland Mary.
Wi' monio a vow and lockad embrnna
our parting was fu’ tandm,
and pledging aft to meet again
we tore onrsaln neander.
bnt oh fell daath’a untimely froat,
that nipt my flower saa early !
now green’s the sod and eauld‘a tha clay
that wraps my Highland Many.
Ο pale, pale now those roay lips
1 aft hae kiased sae fondly,
and closed for aye the sparkh'ng glanna
that dwelt on me sne kindly,
and mouldaring now in silent dunt
that haara that lo’ed ma daarly:
but still within my bosom's cora
shall live my Highland Mary.

BURNS.
