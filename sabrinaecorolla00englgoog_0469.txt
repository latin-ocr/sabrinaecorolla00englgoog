Perfeci Day*

GIFT of God! Ο perfect day!
wherein shall no man work bnt phy:
- who-mn ῑι is enough fm- me

not ιο be doing hut to be.

through every fibra of my hrain,

through every nonve and every vein

1 feel the alectria chrm, the touch

οἰ life thnt ulmos& seems hoo much.

&Vhile over me unx-ullu οιι high

the splendid sochen-y of the sky,

where through n sapphira εει the nnn
snilu like n gohier: gaunon,

wwnrds yonder cloudlnnd iu the Wene
towards yonder island· of the blan,
whose sheep sien-n tar uplifm

its erhggy summit white with ‹ix-ists.
Lonorsstnow.
