ΤΙιε Dan-aanor} of Ssmuzoherffl.

*HE Assyn'nn mmo down like the wolf on the fuld,

, And hin ennom wem glenming in purple aad gold,

· and the ahman of their apaan was like scm-s on
the εει,

where the mua «Μ ωιιμ nightly on deep Galum.

Like um leaves of ιιιε sores: when summer is green,

that host with their bunum-s nt suusne were seen:

like 1120 lem-es of the forest when autumn hnffl blown,

thnt host ou the mon-ow lay withan-ecl und stt-own.

For the Augel of Dmh spx-end his wings ou the blase,

and brathea on the sace of the foe μ 110 passed,

aud tho eyes of the nleepers wnxed deadly und chin.

und their hearts but oneo henved, and for ever grew still*

And there lay the stood with ιις, nostru »u wido,

bnt through it there rollnd noc che breuth of his pride;

and the svam of his guph-ng lay white on the turs,

und cul-2 as the spruy ot* the rock-bentiug eux-f.

And enm lay the vider distorwd aad pale,

with the dew on his brow, auri the rust on his mni! ;

and the cents were all εἰὶειιι, the hannem alone,

ιιιο lumea upusted, the erumpas unblown.

And the widows of Ashur m lond in their wnil,

and the idola ure broke in the templs οἱ Bul,

and the might os the Gentile, unsmote by the swerd,

:mh melted, like suow, in the glauce os the Lord*

ιοιῑυ umus.
