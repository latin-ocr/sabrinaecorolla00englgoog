ahall the dire curae eternally endurci
and shall our lated race ne¹er rise again
with blenaiuga crownedi' all mortal things decay:
the noblest powers, the pnrest joys of life
at length subsidet theu wherefore not the curae?

and have Ι vainly hoped that, guarded here,
secludcd from the fortnnes of my rece,
1 with pure heart and hands some future day

might cleanse the deep defilement of our house?
coerce was my brother iu my circling arms
from raging madnesa suddenly restored,
when unrelenting fate with irou houd
a double crime onycino, commending me
to steal the image sacred and revered‚
confided to my care, and him deceive,
to whom I owe my life and destiny.
let not abhorrenee spring within my breast,
nor the old Titan's hate towards you, ye Gods,
infix ita vulture talons in my breastl
an ancient song comes back upon my ear
(I had forgottan it, and williugly,)
the Parcae'e song, which horrihly they sang,
what tima, hurled heedlong from hia golden seat,
fell Tantalus, they with their noble friend
keen enguish suffered3 ravage was their breast,
und horriblc their song. in days gone by,
when we were children, oft our ancient nurse
would cing it to ns, and I marked it well.
